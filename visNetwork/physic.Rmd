require("visNetwork", quietly = TRUE)
```

### The physics of the network is highly configurable

Using **visPhysics()** function, you can play with the physics of the network :

* choose the ````solver```` ('barnesHut', 'repulsion', 'hierarchicalRepulsion', 'forceAtlas2Based'), and set options

* control the ````stabilization```` processus : 

    + playing with ````maxVelocity```` and ````minVelocity````
  
    + disable stabilization for rendering initial network and see stabilization processes
  
    + ....

```{r}
nodes <- data.frame(id = 1:10)
edges <- data.frame(from = round(runif(8)*10), to = round(runif(8)*10))

visNetwork(nodes, edges, height = "500px", width = "100%") %>%
 visPhysics(solver = "forceAtlas2Based", 
            forceAtlas2Based = list(gravitationalConstant = -500))
```


```{r}
visNetwork(nodes, edges, height = "500px", width = "100%") %>%
 visPhysics(solver = "barnesHut")
```
